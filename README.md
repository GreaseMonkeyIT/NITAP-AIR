This puzzle game was made with the original intention to act as a sort of stepping stone to simulating a micromouse maze. 
However, as time went on, we went on to deviate from the original project objectives and started trying to make the game look as good as possible. 

This is still however, a very small project meant to just demonstrate our amateurish skills at game development.
